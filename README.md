# APCV 485 Coding Lab 1

## Building My First Neural Network

Welcome to Lab 1. This project is my first end-to-end neural network build in APCV 485, where I go from data prep to model evaluation with clear diagnostics.

## What this lab covers

- Generating and preparing a synthetic binary-classification dataset
- Building a feed-forward neural network with TensorFlow/Keras
- Training with validation tracking
- Evaluating with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Reviewing training curves and bonus experiments

## Results snapshot

- Final test accuracy is around **90%** in the notebook run
- Training/validation behavior is visualized to check learning quality
- Classification report and confusion matrix are included for class-level performance

## Files

- `building-my-first-neural-network.ipynb` - complete notebook workflow

## How to run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Install dependencies if needed:
   - `tensorflow`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-learn`
3. Run all cells top to bottom.

## Why this is cool

This lab turns neural-network concepts into something tangible: data in, model out, metrics and visuals to explain what happened. It is the foundation for the more security-focused modeling in later labs.
